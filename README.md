# Multi Git Manager

The point of this application is to automatically pull/commit/push changes on a lot of repositories with only one command. I use it every day to track all the study repositories I work with at University.

Check the quick demo of the app [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5WR6-VmcA)

If you have any idea how to improve my code let me know or create a pull request ðŸ˜‰.

## Todo

Everything I am currently working on you can find [here](https://github.com/Azalurg/PythonGitScript/projects/1)

## Requirements and installation 

You will need:
- git
- python 3.5 (or higher)

To install the app in the root directory run ```python setup.py install``` 

## Start the app

In order to start, you can run one of the scripts from the  ```/scripts``` directory or manually run the **pythonGitManager.py** file.

Be aware, to work script needs your git accounts/ssh-keys/passwords to be safe on your PC (maybe in the future it will change).
